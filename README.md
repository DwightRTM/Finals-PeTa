## How to Play?
### Here’s how it works:

1️⃣ Rock-Paper-Scissors Minus One:

You and the bot each get two moves.
The game shouts "Minus One!" and you’ve gotta pick one move to keep.
Winner of RPS decides who holds the revolver:
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper

2️⃣ Russian Roulette:

If you lose, it’s revolver time.
Choose:
Shoot yourself (play risky for rewards like extra lives or bonus damage).
Shoot the bot (no rewards, but you could take them out).

3️⃣ Lives:

You both start with 3 lives. Each bullet hit = -1 life.
First to hit zero loses.

4️⃣ Rounds & Reset:

Every 6 rounds, the revolver resets with a fresh chamber.
Pro tip: Surviving this long means the stakes get higher.

5️⃣ Exit Anytime:

Wanna tap out? No shame—just say the word and you’re out.
